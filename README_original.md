# Impromptu

This is my personal CPU-based 3D raster graphics engine that implements a minimal 3D graphics API. The intent of this project is to give me a better understanding of what implementations of graphics APIs such as OpenGL, Vulkan, and Direct3D do under the hood.

The only required external library is [SDL2](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases) (for window and user input management).

By default, Impromptu uses perspective projection with first-person camera controls.

# Building and Running

I build the project with `gcc` on Windows. The build command I use in development looks something like

```
gcc -pedantic -Wall -Werror -fgnu89-inline -std=c99 ^
main.c engine.c model.c vector3.c matrix4.c^
-I[Path to SDL2 includes] ^
-L[Path to SDL2 libraries] ^
-lSDL2 -lSDL2main -lmingw32 ^
-O2 ^
-o impromptu.exe 
```

When running the program, make sure `SDL2.dll` (can be found in the SDL2 link above) is in the same directory as the output executable.
